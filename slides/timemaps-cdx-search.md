# An API Primer for Web Archives

In these examples we'll use [@SputnikNewsUS](https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS), which is no longer on the live web.  This account was for the US version of [Sputnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_(news_agency)), a Russian state-affiliated news outlet.  Note that other accounts, like [@SputnikInt](https://twitter.com/@SputnikInt), still exist.

## Memento TimeGates and TimeMaps

Memento operates on the granularity of complete URIs and does not support a search function with wildcards.  

To redirect via a TimeGate to the latest copy via IA's Memento TimeGate (no Accept-Datetime value defaults to the most recent archived version):

```
curl -I https://web.archive.org/web/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS
HTTP/2 302 
server: nginx/1.15.8

```

To redirect to the version closest to 2016-07-09:

```
curl -I -H "Accept-Datetime: Sat, 09 Jul 2016 00:00:00 GMT" https://web.archive.org/web/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS

To retrieve a TimeMap from IA (note only the first 10 lines are shown via the `head` command):

```
curl -s https://web.archive.org/web/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS | head -10
<https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="original",
<https://web.archive.org/web/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="self"; type="application/link-format"; from="Wed, 03 Dec 2014 23:45:50 GMT",
<https://web.archive.org>; rel="timegate",
<https://web.archive.org/web/20141203234550/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="first memento"; datetime="Wed, 03 Dec 2014 23:45:50 GMT",
<https://web.archive.org/web/20141216130302/http://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="memento"; datetime="Tue, 16 Dec 2014 13:03:02 GMT",
<https://web.archive.org/web/20141216130304/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="memento"; datetime="Tue, 16 Dec 2014 13:03:04 GMT",
<https://web.archive.org/web/20141220182702/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="memento"; datetime="Sat, 20 Dec 2014 18:27:02 GMT",
<https://web.archive.org/web/20141228222618/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="memento"; datetime="Sun, 28 Dec 2014 22:26:18 GMT",
<https://web.archive.org/web/20141231233757/http://twitter.com:80/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="memento"; datetime="Wed, 31 Dec 2014 23:37:57 GMT",
<https://web.archive.org/web/20150109163639/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="memento"; datetime="Fri, 09 Jan 2015 16:36:39 GMT",
```

Using `grep` and `wc`, we can find out how many mementos in the IA's TimeMap:

```
curl -s https://web.archive.org/web/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS | grep "rel=.*memento" | wc -l
73
```

But IA is not the only archive.  archive.is has one copy in its TimeMap:

```
curl https://archive.is/timemap/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS
<https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="original",
<http://archive.md/timegate/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="timegate",
<http://archive.md/20150531154001/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="first last memento"; datetime="Sun, 31 May 2015 15:40:01 GMT",
<http://archive.md/timemap/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS>; rel="self"; type="application/link-format"; from="Sun, 31 May 2015 15:40:01 GMT"; until="Sun, 31 May 2015 15:40:01 GMT"
```

And here is a request to [MemGator](https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/), which aggregates access to 16 different public web archives:

```
curl -s https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS | head

```

This request shows only the versions *not* at the IA (`grep datetime` selects only memento lines (no `rel="self"` etc. lines), and `grep -v web.archive.org` filters out IA mementos):

```
curl -s https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS | grep datetime | grep -v web.archive.org | head

```

This request shows how many copies are in which archives:

```
curl -s https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS | grep datetime | awk '{print $1}' | awk -v FS=/ '{print $3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
      1 archive.md
      1 www.webarchive.org.uk
     27 wayback.archive-it.org
     73 web.archive.org
```

Note that MemGator supports other formats, such as json:

```
curl -s https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/json/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS | head -17
{
  "original_uri": "https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS",

      },
```


## CDX API

Memento TimeGates and TimeMaps only work on full URIs and do not support wild card searching.  This can be a problem with Twitter, which [supports multiple languages via arguments](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2019/03/2019-03-18-cookie-violations-cause.html) (e.g., `?lang=ru`).  Technically, these are different URIs, even though they produce the same results:

```
https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS
```

and 

```
https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS?lang=en
```

Since the individual web archives do not know to canonicalize the two above URIs into a single URI, they are indexed differently, leading to different TimeMaps.  In fact, Twitter has support for 47 different languages, meaning we have to dereference many different TimeMap URIs to find all the copies:

```
curl -s "https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS" | grep datetime | wc -l
102
curl -s "https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS?lang=en" | grep datetime | wc -l
7
curl -s "https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS?lang=fr" | grep datetime | wc -l
6
curl -s "https://memgator.cs.odu.edu/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS?lang=de" | grep datetime | wc -l
5
```

Furthermore, deep links to individual Tweets are all but impossible to guess if you don't already have a link for that tweet.  And since @SputnikNewsUS is no longer live, the Twitter API won't help us.  For example, if you did not already know this URI:

```
https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS/status/1020522510494789632
```

You would not know to make this request for its TimeMap:

```
curl https://web.archive.org/web/timemap/link/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS/status/1020522510494789632

Fortunately, 1) Twitter builds its URIs left-to-right, and 2) the IA CDX API supports a "prefix" search.  Here's a query to the IA CDX API, looking for deep links (i.e., with `status` in the URI):

This returns raw [CDX format](https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/cdx-format/cdx-2015/), which is sometimes desirable, but sometimes you just want a clickable URI-M.  The following command converts the CDX format into URI-Ms (and this time showing the *last* 30 entries via the `tail` command):

```
curl -s "http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS&matchType=prefix" | awk '{print "https://web.archive.org/web/" $2 "/" $3};' | tail -30

Here's a command for just the deep links (i.e., with `status` in the URIs):

```
curl -s "http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS/status&matchType=prefix" | awk '{print "https://web.archive.org/web/" $2 "/" $3};' | head

In the above, we have two different copies of the tweet id `1007884228946776064`, archived just one second apart.  That might not be what we want.  This command sorts and uniques on the tweet id (CDX key=3) so we only get one copy, then transforms into URI-Ms:

```
curl -s "http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS/status&matchType=prefix" | sort -u -k 3 | awk '{print "https://web.archive.org/web/" $2 "/" $3};' | head

```

This command sorts and unqiues on status id, then resorts on Memento-Datetime (key=2), so the URI-Ms are arranged in chronological order:

```
curl -s "http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS/status&matchType=prefix" | sort -u -k 3 | sort -k 2 | awk '{print "https://web.archive.org/web/" $2 "/" $3};' | head

Note some of the additional arguments (`screen_name` and `lang`) that appear for tweet id `546358360204128257`.  If you don't want those to be considered, use `sed` to strip off the URI arguments while still in the CDX format and then process as above:

```
curl -s "http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS/status&matchType=prefix" | sed 's/?.*//' | sort -u -k 3 | sort -k 2 | awk '{print "https://web.archive.org/web/" $2 "/" $3};' | head

```

Note the `https://web.archive.org/web//` entry above -- I think this snuck in because the CDX file has some malformed URI entries.  Or it could be that I've made some bad assumptions about all the lines in the CDX formats or applied an overly aggressive regular expression.  Rather than chase down the culprit, I'll leave it as a cautionary tale.  


## archive.is URI search

Note that archive.is has a similar prefix search, though I'm unsure if they support a machine readable (e.g., link or json format) of these URIs:

[http://archive.is/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS*](http://archive.is/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS*)

[http://archive.is/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS/status/*](http://archive.is/https://twitter.com/SputnikNewsUS/status/*)
